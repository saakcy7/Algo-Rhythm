# Algo-Rhythm

This project is a React-based website that provides information about popular algorithms including Binary Search, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

# Overview
This website aims to educate users about fundamental algorithms used in computer science. Each algorithm is explained with its purpose, time complexity, and a brief description of its implementation.

#  Algorithms Covered
## Binary Search

Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and continues narrowing down the search until the target is found or determined to be absent.

Time Complexity: O(log n)

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the sorted array.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)

## Quick Sort

Quick Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot, placing elements smaller than the pivot to its left and larger elements to its right. It then recursively sorts the subarrays.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average
